# Basic CRUD Application

I made a basic CRUD application to help myself understand the relationship between a MySQL database and php. I include my database setup information within *dbconnect.php*. I used a GUI to create my database, but I added a similar setup to my own in *database.sql*, or you could use your own.

I used Bootstrap to style and will improve this aspect.

### Still To-Do:

There are many ways I could improve the state of this app. **Most importantly**, I have to escape the queries I pass through in order to prevent possible SQL injection. Also general improvements to styling and functionality.

- [ ] Escape all queries
- [ ] Improve styling
- [ ] Fix any other potential issues
- [ ] Add any additional functionality
